# CodSoft Internship

## Overview

Welcome to the GitHub repository showcasing my internship journey at CodSoft. During this internship, I had the privilege of working on three impactful tasks that allowed me to apply and enhance my skills in data science and machine learning.

### 1. Credit Card Fraud Detection

In the first task, I undertook an extensive analysis of a financial dataset ('fraudTest.csv') and developed machine learning models for fraud detection. This task not only showcased my proficiency in data exploration, visualization, and classification algorithms but also laid the foundation for subsequent challenges.

### 2. Customer Churn Price Prediction

For the second task, I delved into Customer Churn Price Prediction. The project involved thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and visualization. I trained models using three distinct machine learning algorithms and provided insightful predictions, offering valuable insights into customer retention strategies.

### 3. SMS Spam Detection

The third task focused on SMS Spam Detection. I engaged in meticulous data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature extraction to prepare the data for analysis. Employing three different machine learning algorithms, I conducted spam classification and compared their performance using various metrics, ultimately identifying spam and non-spam messages.

## Repository Structure
